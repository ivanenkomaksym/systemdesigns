# System designs

## Design a Scalable REST API

Design and implement a RESTful API for a product catalog in an e-commerce system. The API should support CRUD operations for products and allow filtering by category and price range:
- Proper API design with REST principles.
- Handling pagination, filtering, and sorting.
- Use of DTOs and validation.
- Consideration of caching and rate-limiting.
- How you structure dependency injection and logging.
